      <description>Who Am I? I&amp;rsquo;m Odin, a 4th year computer engineering student at UBC. Throughout my time at UBC, I have taken a variety of courses in software engineering, ranging from data structures and algorithms, to computer communications, to cybersecurity. I have done both front-end (Android, React, and React Native), and back-end (FastAPI, NodeJS, MySQL) development during my co-ops, class projects, and projects with UBC Launchpad.
Interests I love to read. I enjoy the depth offered by books, both in fiction and non-fiction, that cannot be found in film or television, or in the news.</description>
